# Node-Qt

Node-Qt provides native bindings to the [Qt library](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/) as a [Node.js addon](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/addons.html). The focus is on graphics and audio bindings; there is no need to duplicate the functionality of the Node API and its modules.

We try to follow [Qt's API](http://developer.qt.nokia.com/doc/qt-4.8/) as closely as possible, but sometimes quirks are inevitable (for example, virtual methods that handle events are translated into callback setters). See the header files in `src/` for a list of available bindings, and comments in `.cc` files for possible API differences. 

For a translation of Qt's APIs into HTML5 APIs, see [Node-Five](http://github.com/arturadib/node-five).

Supported platforms: **Mac OS X** | **Windows** | **Linux**


#### Hello world

Ever wanted to create native apps directly from Node? Here's a simple example illustrating how to create a native window via `QWidget()` and draw via `QPainter()`:

![Screenshot](https://github.com/arturadib/node-qt/raw/master/examples/helloworld.png)

```javascript
var qt = require("node-qt");
var app = new qt.QApplication();
var window = new qt.QWidget();

// Quirk: the virtual method paintEvent() is mapped into a callback setter
window.paintEvent(function() {
    var p = new qt.QPainter();
    p.begin(window);
    p.drawText(20, 30, 'hello node, hello qt');
    p.end();
});

window.resize(300, 150);
window.show();

app.exec();
```











# Getting started

From your project directory, run (see below for requirements):

```
$ npm install node-qt
```

Alternatively, to use the latest development version from Github:

```
$ npm install git://github.com/arturadib/node-qt.git
```

This will download and build Node-Qt in `node_modules/`. Then create a new file, say `helloworld.js`, copy the example above and run Node as usual:

```
$ node helloworld
```

See the [examples/](https://github.com/arturadib/node-qt/tree/master/examples) directory for other simple use cases.











# Build requirements

Node-Qt was designed to build seamlessly with minimal dependencies on most platforms. The necessary platform-dependent Qt binaries are bundled with the module (due to heterogeneous dependencies, Linux is an exception).

For all platforms: Node >= **0.6.14**

+ **Mac:** Python, Make, and GCC.
+ **Windows:** Python and MSVC++ (either [free](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-cpp-express) or commercial).
+ **Linux:** Python, Make, GCC, pkg-config, and Qt 4.7+. To install pkg-config and Qt on Ubuntu: `$ sudo apt-get install pkg-config qt-sdk`.

## Building and testing

To download and build the development version:

```
$ git clone git://github.com/arturadib/node-qt.git
$ cd node-qt
$ npm install
```

To run the unit tests:

```
$ node make test
```

(Ignore the image regression errors - they are based on snapshots that are platform- and backend-dependent).



## Creating new bindings

Please provide a test case for every new binding added. See `test/` for examples of unit tests.

#### Binding to new classes

1. Create your files (e.g. `qclass.h`, `qclass.cc`) from the provided templates `src/template.h`, `src/template.cc`
2. `qclass.*`: search and replace all occurrences of `__Template__`, `__TEMPLATE__`, and `__template__` with the corresponding class name
3. `node-qt.gyp`: Add qclass.cc to sources list
4. `qt.cc`: Include `qclass.h`
5. `qt.cc`: Add `QClass::Initialize()` to `Initialize()`

#### Binding to new methods

1. `qclass.h`: Declare static method as per `Example()` method in `template.h`
2. `qclass.cc`: Implement method as per `Example()` in `template.cc`
3. `qclass.cc`: Expose method to JavaScript via `tpl->PrototypeTemplate()` call in `Initialize()`. Again see template.cc.


## Common errors

This is a list of common errors when experimenting with Node addons, and their possible solutions:

_"Out of memory"_

`name` in `NODE_MODULE(name, ...)` does not match target name?

_"Unable to load shared library"_

`(v8 object)->Set()` called to register a method, but method implementation 
is missing?

_"Segmentation fault"_

Tough luck :) Did you forget to `new` a wrapped object?
